# Kaggle

A place to explore Kaggle.com ML challenges.

1. I begin by expanding the Kaggle tutorial on how to use NumPy and CSV packages in "Titanic - NumPy and CSV packages.ipynb" - this makes a model based on "train.csv" and applies it to "test.csv". I output two predictions - a "ModelBasedonGenderAlone.csv", and then a "ModelBasedonGenderClass.csv"
